## ℹ️ Overview

This portfolio consists of 3 different projects done throughout my college years. it is divided into 3 different folders, 

- Portfolio Website
- Mechanic Shop Database
- booking page 

All of these projects were build for either a class project, a personal website or to solve a technical problem. The skills implemented in this 
project involve a lot of problem solving, guidence and some involved team work. these projects helped me develop my skills in tech and allowed me to find 
my true passion when it comes to software engineering. some of these project involved full stack development, some involved back-end only and some front-end. Through these projects I was able to find what I want to continue pursuing and keep working on more personal projects similar to that. 

### Portfolio Website

This project byitself is pretty self explanitory. This is my 3rd and final Portfolio website that i've built for myself. I started by using html and css for a basic personal website. However, when I built more projects using react and JS I was able to come up with a portfolio website that had more aimaitions, more structure and overall better UI expereince. 

## Frameworks & technicals 

some of the frameworks I used were **Next.js**
I used 2 main langueges **Typescript** for the the structure and the function handling & **CSS** for styling the webpage. 
I also used **Vercel** for webhosting live

## Usage 

I use this website mostly for showcasing my skills on a personlaized webspage to recruiters and job postings. This project has helped me build web developing skills along with framework handling. 

There is no installations required for this project, simply cliking on the live link hosted by Vercel, everyone with the link can see my Portfolio website.
