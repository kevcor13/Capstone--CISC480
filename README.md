## ℹ️ Overview

This portfolio consists of 3 different projects done throughout my college years. it is divided into 3 different folders, 

- Portfolio Website
- Mechanic Shop Database
- booking page 

All of these projects were build for either a class project, a personal website or to solve a technical problem. The skills implemented in this 
project involve a lot of problem solving, guidence and some involved team work. these projects helped me develop my skills in tech and allowed me to find 
my true passion when it comes to software engineering. some of these project involved full stack development, some involved back-end only and some front-end. Through these projects I was able to find what I want to continue pursuing and keep working on more personal projects similar to that. 

## Portfolio Website

Link; https://github.com/kevcor13/portfolio


This portfolio project allowed me to showcase my personal skills all one website while also using my skills to create a "Hub" that will hold all of my projects in one. makign this project it allowed me to reflect on my work and trully see what was important. It made me analyze and reflect on the struggles and learnign process that I need to make these projects come to live. This website/portfolio shows not only about me, but also how my projects have contributed to the common good. It shows my interests and what impacts I have made with these projects. Some of these projects have solved problems that needed to be solved and it cultivated to establishing a responsible leadership across all of my projects. Overall this website/portfolio gave me the ability to showcase my projects and demonstrarte to the world the types of impacts ive made and continue to make in the technological world as a computer science student. 


## Mechanic Shop Database 


Link: https://github.com/kevcor13/DB450----final-Project-


This was a class project that I had built for database design. This was one of the classes I was looking forward the most in my college classes becuased it was the one that I knew it would be the most interesting for me. This class really showed me how everything is stored/secured among every single company out there. Similar to Data Structures, this class opened my eyes to see that the way things operate is more complicated than I thought. Therefore, the idea for this project was born. 


The task was to solve a real world problem involving a database. We needed to assign the problem, and solve it by building a special database that would fit the customers need. I thought about how my father is a mechanic and he always struggles with inventory management, invoices and customer tracker. Therefore, a team of 3 of us built a database for a mechanic shop. We used the skills learned in class about databases, along with new programing languages. We initially built a structure map for this database to make sure it would fit the needs of this mechanic shop. We then moved on to programing this database from scratch. In the end this database worked and till this day it is being used by my father to keep track of inventory, invoices, and customers. I am really proud of this database because not only was I able to learn new skills along the way, but also contributed to the common good by solving a real-world issue. 


Overall this project gave me an opportunity to showcase my skills and solve a real-world issue. it allowed me to build teamwork skills. We as a team needed to communicate efficiently to make sure we were all on the same page. We also learned new skills together and adapted to each other's style of working. This project is one of my favorite ones i've made, because as mentioned before, not only did I managed to put all my skills together, but also contibuted to the common good. 


## Booking page

This booking page is another project that I am really proud of. This project consisted of learning new skills, including API's, Front-end development, back-end development, Google API's etc. This was a personal project that I built for previous staff member here at the university of St. Thomas. She needed a specialized booking page that allowed her to set scholarship interview appointment for the new upcoming freshman/transfer students. Now you may thing, there are a lot of options out there. However, she gave me the opportunity to show my skills and develop a booking page for her, so that she does not need to pay another software. I took this opportunity and began to build this booking page. 


Some of the key features she wanted in this booking page included, adding specific time slots for appointments, tracking down appointments on a google spreadsheet, sending email reminders to the student and the interviewer, good UI that seems proffesional. All of these requirements lead me to learning how API function calls work and how to make them work efficiently, as well as website hosting and authentication. For API interaction I used Google Apps Scripts that allowed me to send email reminders to both parties as well as edit the google spreadsheet (Add/delete) appointments. Lastly this booking page provides a booking link that can be sent to the student, allowing them to book an appointment. 


This project provided to the common good because once again, it solved a real-world issue and eliminated the need to purchase subscriptions for a 3rd party software, eliminating school cost and bringing more efficiency. After interview season was over, I then transfered this project over to my car window tinting business, which allowed me to handle scheduling efficiently. As we can see, this project works in multiple environments. This booking page can be efficient to any small business. I plan on expanding this project and adding more features in the near future, right now my goal is to see this project be used in small business across minnesota, so that it can bring them efficiency and increase time management across business. 

## Summary 

In conclusion, this portfolio showcases three major projects completed throughout my college years—a personal portfolio website, a mechanic shop database, and a custom booking page—each reflecting my growth in software engineering across front-end, back-end, and full-stack development. These projects strengthened my problem-solving abilities, teamwork skills, and technical expertise while helping me discover my passion for building real-world solutions. My portfolio website serves as a hub that highlights my work and its impact; the mechanic shop database, created as a team for a class, solved a real business need and is still used by my father today; and the booking page, originally built for a university staff member and later adapted for my tinting business, demonstrates my ability to learn new technologies, work with APIs, and deliver practical, cost-saving tools. Collectively, these projects illustrate my commitment to meaningful, user-focused development and the positive contributions I strive to make through technology. I am beyond greatful to have gained these opportunities to have build project like these to showcase my skills, adapt new ones and master them. While working on these projects i've realized that things arent always as simple as they seem to be. It requires skills, determination, problem solving and most importantly, it requires you to be motivated by somethign greater than the project itself. This motivation comes from the idea of the common good. Why am I building these project? What is the purpose of this? How will this benifit the common person? All of these questions were my motivation to stay determine and motivated to complete these projects, and that is what St. Thomas is all about, thinking critically to solve real-world problems, be morally responsible in your daily tasks/projects and most importantly, work skillfully to advance the common good.
